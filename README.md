# Streamlabs Chatbot Multishoutout Script
---
> For those who doesn't want to do a shout out command for multiple targets

With Streamlabs Desktop Chatbot custom scripts are supported. And because I, as many others, are lazy, I looked for a script so that I don't have to type as much in my Twitch chat. 

## Installation: 
---
1. Follow the instructions in the official documentation on [how to install scripts with Streamlabs Chatbot](https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/chatbot-scripts-desktop).
2. Download the script ZIP file from github
3. Import the script through the UI
4. Select your settings, press Save Settings, right-click to reload script.
5. Enjoy!

# TODO:
- Figure out how to use cooldowns.
- Add API function to collect information such as what the target played last.
- Figure out how to do a fancy separator that will be the actual width of the Twitch chat window

Please note that I don't actually know how to code. I just spent a month on trying to understand the official documentation and googling how to use Python 2.7 while trying to decipher what does what in the official script template from Streamlabs. 

I re-wrote and based this script on the already fully functional [Multi_Shoutout script by Castorr](https://github.com/castorr/Chatbot-Scripts/tree/master/Tools/Multi_Shoutout) and the template script [Boilerplate from Streamlabs](https://github.com/AnkhHeart/Streamlabs-Chatbot-Python-Boilerplate). All credit goes to them, because the only real difference is that this script is written worse than the original and I can break this one how much I want. I just wanted to be able to tag my targets in the shout out message. 

## I want this feature!
Well... See above... I can try, but no promises.
